## Advice

You can't do better than visit the [Interactive Fiction Community Forum](https://intfiction.org),
a gathering-place for IF authors and readers, now under the auspices of the
the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org).

## Report bugs

Until 2019, the Inform project used a [Mantis-powered bug tracker](http://inform7.com/mantis).
We are now in the process of migrating to Jira, but for the time being, bugs
may still be reported to the Mantis tracker. (All issues are being migrated.)
