### The Two Books

The Inform app comes with two books built in. These are interwoven, and
contain nearly 500 examples of the system in use. _Writing with Inform_ is
a tutorial, centred around building familiarity, one new topic at a time.
_The Inform Recipe Book_ is based instead about different things you might
want to simulate: money, clothing, liquids, conversation, breakable
glass, the human body, and so on.

The books are part of every download and in some ways it's better to read
them there. (You can click on an example and see it working, and so on.)
But the full text of the two books is also found on this website, for the
benefit of Mr Google:

### The Change Log

At one time, changes to Inform were logged on the website, but they now
live in the GitHub repository for the source code. See:
