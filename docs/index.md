Note: The Inform 7 website is migrating to be served by Github Pages rather
than Dreamhost, as at present. The pages here are under construction for now
and may exhibit all kinds of glitches. [The original inform7.com](http://inform7.com)
will remain online until the domain name is transferred here.

The Inform source repository is now public and is [here](https://github.com/ganelson/inform).

Inform is a free app for creating works of interactive fiction, available for
MacOS, Windows, Linux and Android. Inside it is a powerful programming
language based on English language text.

Many Inform authors also [write with Twine](http://twinery.org), and vice versa.
Inform topics are frequently aired at the [Interactive Fiction Community Forum](https://intfiction.org).
The Inform project supports the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org/).
Lastly, [Emily Short's Interactive Storytelling](https://emshort.blog) contains
some of the best writing about the genre today, and also hosts many more links.
