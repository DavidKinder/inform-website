    <p class="sectionheading">ยง3.7. Properties depend on kind</p>
    <p>Properties depend very much on kind. It makes no sense to ask whether a room is transparent or opaque, for instance, so Inform will not allow this either to be specified or queried.</p>
    <p>Another way that kind influences properties can be seen from an earlier example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c208"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c208"></a>The Gazebo is a room. A billiards table is in the Gazebo. On it is a trophy cup. A starting pistol is in the cup.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The cup, the pistol and the table are all allowed to have the &quot;fixed in place&quot; property, but in fact only the table actually has it: the cup and the pistol are created as &quot;portable&quot; instead. This is because Inform knows that most things are portable, but that supporters - such as the table - are usually fixed in place. If this assumption is wrong, we need only add the line:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c209"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c209"></a>The table is portable.
    </p>
