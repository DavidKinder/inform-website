Inform is a programming language for creating interactive fiction, using natural
language syntax. Using natural language and drawing on ideas from linguistics
and from literate programming, Inform is widely used as a medium for literary
writing, as a prototyping tool in the games industry, and in education, both at
school and university level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses
on digital narrative). It has several times ranked in the top 100 most
influential programming languages according to the TIOBE index. Created in April
2006, it was open-sourced in April 2022.

News items appear below, and a copy of the [Inform language documentation is also on this website](doc/).
Other useful resources on Inform include:

* [The latest release of Inform](https://github.com/ganelson/inform/releases/latest).
Apps for MacOS, Windows and Linux are available from this link.
* [Proposals for evolution of Inform](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution).
* [The source code for Inform at GitHub](https://github.com/ganelson/inform).
* [The source code published as a literate program](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/).
* [The bug tracker at Jira](https://inform7.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/I7/issues) is likely
to migrate to GitHub Issues in the nearish future, but it's there now. The old Mantis
bug tracker has closed, but all data from it was carried over.
* [Inform topics](https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/inform-7/19) are frequently aired at the [Interactive Fiction Community Forum](https://intfiction.org).
* In particular, the very useful [Inform 7 documentation and resources](https://intfiction.org/t/inform-7-documentation-and-resources/3311) post is there.
* More than 1000 stories written with Inform are listed at the [Interactive Fiction Database](https://ifdb.org/search?sortby=ratu&newSortBy.x=0&newSortBy.y=0&searchfor=system%3AInform+7).
* The Inform project supports the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org/).
* The [Interactive Fiction Wiki](https://www.ifwiki.org/Main_Page) is vastly useful.
* [IFComp](http://ifcomp.org), an annual event founded in 1995, and the more
informal [Spring Thing](https://www.springthing.net/), founded 2002, have become
part of our calendar.
* The [Narrascope](https://narrascope.org) conferences bring industry, academia
and independent writers together.
* Many Inform authors also [write with Twine](http://twinery.org), and vice versa.
* Lastly, [Emily Short's Interactive Storytelling](https://emshort.blog) contains
some of the best writing about the genre today, and also hosts many more links.

*Note*: The Inform 7 website is migrating to be served by Github Pages rather
than Dreamhost, as at present. The pages here are under construction for now
and may exhibit all kinds of glitches.
