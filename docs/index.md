# A Design System for Interactive Fiction

<img src="/assets/images/icon.png" alt="Inform icon" width="700" height="450" />

Inform is a free app for creating works of interactive fiction, available for
MacOS, Windows, Linux and Android. Inside it is a powerful programming
language based on English language text. This redesigned website is part
of the [preparations for open-sourcing the software](/talks/2019/06/14/narrascope.html).

Many Inform authors also [write with Twine](http://twinery.org), and vice versa.
Inform topics are frequently aired at the [Interactive Fiction Community Forum](https://intfiction.org).
The Inform project supports the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org/).
Lastly, [Emily Short's Interactive Storytelling](https://emshort.blog) contains
some of the best writing about the genre today, and also hosts many more links.
