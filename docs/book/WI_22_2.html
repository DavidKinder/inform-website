    <p class="sectionheading">ยง22.2. Descriptions as values</p>
    <p>In the chapter on Descriptions, we saw that a description can be any source text which describes one or more objects: it might be as simple as &quot;the Corn Market&quot;, or as complicated as &quot;open containers which are in dark rooms&quot;. More or less the only restriction is that it must be unambiguous as to what counts and what does not: &quot;three containers&quot; is ambiguous as a description because it does not say which three.</p>
    <p>We've now seen several interesting tricks with descriptions. In fact, if D is a description, then</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8657"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8657"></a>say &quot;You gaze mournfully at [the list of D].&quot;;
    <br>
    let the tally be the number of D;
    <br>
    let the surprise prize be a random D;
    <br>
    repeat with item running through D:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>are all standard things to do. These examples make it look as if it must be possible to define phrases which act on descriptions, and in fact it is, because a description can be a value in itself. For example,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8658"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8658"></a>even numbers
    <br>
    open containers which are in dark rooms
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>are values of kind &quot;description of numbers&quot; and &quot;description of objects&quot; respectively. In general, if K is any kind then &quot;description of K&quot; is also a kind. Here is how we might make use of that:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8659"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8659"></a>To enumerate (collection - a description of objects):
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;repeat with the item running through the collection:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;-- [The item].&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This makes &quot;enumerate lighted rooms&quot; run off a list of lighted rooms in a textual format different from the standard one produced by &quot;say the list of lighted rooms&quot;. Inside the definition, &quot;collection&quot; can be used wherever a description might be used: here, for instance, we use it as the range for the repeat loop. (That's only possible because the range is limited in size: Inform wouldn't have allowed us to range through, say, all texts.)</p>
    <p>Purely as a convenience, we can also write &quot;member of&quot; or &quot;members of&quot; in this context. For instance, in the enumerate definition, it would have been just as good to write &quot;...running through the members of the collection...&quot; in the repeat. (Similarly, we could write &quot;number of members of the collection&quot; or &quot;a random member of the collection&quot;, which looks grammatically tidier than writing &quot;number of the collection&quot; or &quot;random of the collection&quot; - though in fact both of these do work.)</p>
    <p>Finally, it's sometimes useful in an abstract situation to test</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn353"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn353"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if </b>(value)<b> matches </b>(description of values)<b>:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_valuematch-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the value matches the description; the kinds must be compatible, or Inform will issue a problem message. There is no point using this for cases where the description is given explicitly:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8660"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8660"></a>if 4 matches even numbers, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>because it is easier to write just:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8661"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8661"></a>if 4 is an even number, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>So this condition is only useful when the description is stored in some variable, and its identity is not known.</p>
