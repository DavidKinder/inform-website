### Inform 7.9 'Iron'

#### 7.9.3 (build 6M62) - December 2015

This is for the most part a maintenance release of Inform, incorporating fixes for nearly 300 issues reported with the previous build, but there are also minor language improvements. The user interface for Mac OS X now supports Extension projects, and a new animated Testing panel replaces the old Skein and Transcript. 

The MacOS Interim release is not a new version of the language: it is an app release compatible with MacOS Catalina, and incorporates three versions in one: 7.9.3, 7.9.2, and 7.9.1. (The current Interim app version is 1.68.1, updated on 14 November 2019, to fix a problem with "Release along with a website".)

#### 7.9.2 (build 6L38) - August 2014

Unlike its predecessor, build 6L02, this release of Inform is aimed almost entirely at maintenance: it fixes around 150 bugs, most of them minor and related to recent changes. Users of 6L02 should be able to upgrade with no preparation needed; users of earlier builds, though, would be well advised to read the notes on the big changes in 6L02 before proceeding. But there is one major development, all the same: for the first time Inform is being released for a mass-market mobile operating system - Android.

#### 7.9.1 (build 6L02) - May 2014

This release is a major reform of a now-mature language which is widely used, and it has been over three years in the making. Text handling is better, Inform can now generate adaptive grammar, there's real number support, and a new Public Library of extensions is being introduced. There are significant improvements in the user interface for Mac OS X. Around 500 bug reports had been filed on the core software since build 6G60, and every one of them has been resolved.

### Inform 7.8 'Hydrogen'

#### 7.8.5 (build 6G60) - December 2010

This release of Inform leaves the core language unchanged, except for the correction of a small number of bugs, and its main purpose is to provide an improved Index. Better maps are drawn on the World Index, and there's more detail across several other pages.

#### 7.8.4 (build 6F95) - October 2010

This maintenance release fixes every core Inform issue logged on the Inform bug tracker up to 25 Oct 2010, which means that it resolves around 180 issues; this change log lists most of them, but omits a few which were simple corrections of typos, and of course doesn't list the small number of issues closed as being misunderstandings. Though there are no significant new features, two additional resources have been added to the core Inform distribution: Andrew Plotkin's Quixe interpreter, allowing Glulx story files to be released as playable websites (something up to now allowed only for Z-machine story files); and Eric Eve's extension "Epistemology", which joins the built-in set for the first time.

#### 7.8.2 (build 6E72) - July 2010

This is a minor maintenance release of Inform, with no new features, which corrects about 60 mostly obscure issues arising from the introduction of the much more substantial 6E59 release.

#### 7.8.1 (build 6E59) - June 2010

This is a major release of Inform: the first in a little over a year, and with a change log well over double the previous record size - large enough to need a table of contents for the first time. Inform has new icons, and a slightly revised design; more than 250 bug reports have been closed, so that it currently has no issues open. There are minor surface enhancements right across the language, and these are (mainly) the result not of fiddling but of substantial rewrites of the underlying compiler. Many exceptions have gone, and the language's design is more uniform as a result.

### Inform 7.7 'Gallium'

#### 7.7.1 (build 5Z71) - April 2009

Build 5Z71 uses around a third as much memory as 5U92, does much less file-handling, is a little faster, and can handle projects unlimited in size. Dimensional checking becomes much more flexible, allowing Inform authors to model the world with quantitative physics, and a new built-in extension, "Metric Units by Graham Nelson", defines all the kinds of value needed. Equations, imitating those in books and papers, are added to the language. The release mechanism is also rewritten, allowing much better CSS-friendly websites to be produced by the Release button. The Recipe Book is expanded and rewritten in its coverage of actions and commands. Lastly but most visibly, the Index is redesigned and the Problem messages relaid to incorporate links to relevant documentation. All 132 issues arising from bug reports since build 5U92 are closed out.

### Inform 7.6 'Fluorine'

#### 7.6.2 (build 5U92) - September 2008

Build 5U92 makes a set of related improvements to the way adjectives, nouns and verbs combine in descriptions. This lifts many restrictions which made talking about values less flexible than talking about objects, and shows the language gradually becoming more general. This brings only subtle (if nice to have) improvements for authors, but improves the coherence of the design of Inform. In addition, directions can now be created freely, fulfilling the last outstanding promise made in the January 2007 consultation document. There are miscellaneous minor improvements, and five months' worth of maintenance changes. All 110 issues arising from bug reports received up to 7 September 2008 have been closed out.

#### 7.6.1 (build 5T18) - April 2008

Build 5T18 is founded on a major reform of the infrastructure supporting Inform. It contains miscellaneous new features to complete the work of implementing the less speculative proposals planned in the January 2007 consultation document. The interface application contains a new Source view for OS X which should handle large projects much better: it will follow on other platforms in subsequent builds. The first steps are made towards an official system for translating I7 into languages of play other than English, something which has previously been done but only with great difficulty. Certain run-time algorithms have been optimised for speed, and all 162 bug reports received up to 26 April 2008 have been closed out.

### Inform 7.5 'Europium'

#### 7.5.2 (build 5J39) - December 2007

Build 5J39 introduces lists as first-class values. For any kind of value K, "list of K" is now also a kind of value, and rich support is provided for building and iterating over lists, which are dynamically resized as necessary. Otherwise little is new, but once again all known bugs have been fixed.

#### 7.5.1 (build 5G67) - November 2007

Build 5G67 presents substantially richer support for handling text: for the first time, arbitrary and manipulable strings of text are first-class values in Inform. Substantial internal reforms, notably a new implementation of the type-checker (now the third such), lead also to other improvements: notably the ability to store and play back entire actions, and a form of boolean type for the first time - "truth state". Finally, Inform is now available for three new operating systems: Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), and Fedora and Ubuntu Linux. We welcome Philip Chimento to the Inform team as the author of the Gnome user interface for Linux.

### Inform 7.4 'Dysprosium'

#### 7.4.4 (build 4X60) - August 2007

Build 4X60 adds 19 new examples and modernises a dozen others, and presents a new volume of built-in documentation: the Inform Recipe Book. It also provides new features for variable text, improves and extends table-handling, allows Glulx-format games to read and write files and communicate with external programs, and allows extensions to create more readable and useful documentation.

#### 7.4.3 (build 4W37) - July 2007

Build 4W37 adds 21 new examples and provides miscellaneous new features. Chief among these are substantial improvements to the parsing of names: nouns can now be recognized by their number or unit properties, and also by their relations, so that 'Understand "bottle of [something related by containment]" as the bottle' will parse BOTTLE OF SAND if and only if the sand is contained in the bottle. We have also made a tentative beginning on support for sound effects to match the existing support for illustrations. As usual a number of bugs are fixed, and although a few issues still remain (the current tally of open issues stands at 13, as compared with a peak of about 330 earlier this year) none are severe and most users seem to find that Inform is fairly reliable, so recent effort has gone into advancing the language rather than maintaining the compiler.

#### 7.4.2 (build 4U65) - May 2007

Build 4U65 once again fixes all bugs reported up to 22 April, but in fact few were found in 4S08; and it removes a hole in the type-checking system, to do with phrases to make decisions, but this will have affected few users. The main aim is an across-the-board reform of how actions are handled and implemented in Inform. Proposals (6.33), (6.35), (6.37) and (6.39) from the January 2007 consultation document are all carried through. It is now much easier to create actions which work equally for all actors, and which need a complicated interaction of rules to work.
