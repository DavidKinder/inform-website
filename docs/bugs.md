## Advice

You can't do better than visit the [Interactive Fiction Community Forum](https://intfiction.org),
a gathering-place for IF authors and readers, now under the auspices of the
the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org).

## Bug reporting

A catalogue of known bugs in Inform, and progress in fixing them, is currently
being hosted by the [Jira bug-tracking service here](https://inform7.atlassian.net/).
Jira is a software industry standard, but takes a little patience to get used to.
Users have to create accounts and log in, but this is free. Please feel free to
report bugs: it's only thanks to users taking the time to do this that we make
progress in maintaining the program.

The [current state of the source code for Inform](https://github.com/ganelson/inform)
sometimes contains bug fixes which haven't yet made it into a numbered release. If
you're a command-line user of Inform and are confident in compiling your own tools,
feel free. The [pending release notes file](https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/notes/working_notes.md)
usually shows the bug fixes currently waiting for the next release.

Until 2019, the Inform project used a Mantis-powered bug tracker, but this has
now closed. All issues on that tracker were migrated to Jira, though their
ID numbers changed in the process.
